# CryptoLearn

This project uses **React** with **Vite**.

To build the project for GitHub Pages, the Vite configuration specifies a base path of `/cryptolearn-github-pages/` and outputs the build to the `docs` directory. This allows GitHub Pages to serve the compiled site directly from that folder.

Run the following command to create the production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

The generated files in `docs/` can then be published using GitHub Pages.
